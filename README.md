# Valorant Cypher Camera Raspberry Pi
Hello everyone to build your own Cypher camera you have to first follow these steps before running the code. For this projekt you will need a **raspberry pi** and a **RPI CAM 5MP** and thats it for the streaming server. 

if your wondering how to connect and setup the camera to the pi i recommend to check out this: [raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/0) if you finish this you can continue with the installation. 
```
pip install picamera
pip install paho-mqtt
pip install opencv-python
```
Tip: if you have truble with the pip install opencv-python i recommend to try this: 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
```
### Code
if your installion was successfull then copy or download the code from the repo.
You can run it with the this command: 
```
python YOUR_FILE_NAME.py
````
then you have to open another terminal and run this cammand to start and stop the server via **MQTT**. 
```
mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.eclipseprojects.io -t camera/control -m "start"
````
to stop the streaming server just run this command:
```
mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.eclipseprojects.io -t camera/control -m "stop"
```
