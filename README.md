# Valorant Cypher Camera Raspberry Pi
Hello everyone! To build your own Cypher camera, you first need to follow these steps before running the code. For this project, you will need a Raspberry Pi and an RPI CAM 5MP â€“ and that's it for the streaming server.

If you're wondering how to connect and set up the camera to the Pi, i recommend checking out this guide: [raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/0). Once you finish this, you can continue with the installation.
```
pip install picamera
pip install paho-mqtt
pip install opencv-python
```
Tip: if you have truble with the pip install opencv-python i recommend to try this: 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
```
### Code
if your installion was successfull then copy or download the code from the repo.
You can run it with the this command: 
```
python YOUR_FILE_NAME.py
````
then you have to open another terminal and run this cammand to start and stop the server via **MQTT**. 
```
mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.eclipseprojects.io -t camera/control -m "start"
````
to stop the streaming server just run this command:
```
mosquitto_pub -h mqtt.eclipseprojects.io -t camera/control -m "stop"
```
